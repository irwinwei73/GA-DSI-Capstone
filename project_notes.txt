>> Background
GI's are

>> Scope is limited to General Insurers.


>> Classification
We want to detect when the UWG for a specific class of insurance is going to be negative, so that the insurer can review its underwriting approach for that class of insurance. Therefore, it would be apt to classify as follows:

== Negative UWG: Positive Class ('1')
== Positive UWG: Negative Class ('0')

>> Description of Data

The data used was extracted from annual reports submitted by all general insurers registered in Singapore to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

Quarterly figures are published by MAS however these are aggregated and caveated as unaudited. Therefore not very useful for modeling.



>> Limitations of data
Large gap between the start-of-period state and end-of-period state and amount of activity that takes place intra-period.


Additional data that insurers will have:
claims statistics (who what when where how)
coverage inception dates
coverage periods


>> Clustering was unable to pick out interpretable clusters

>> Future Work
Further segment insurers based on maturity / size of business and run regression/classification
